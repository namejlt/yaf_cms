Notes:

- making changes to a config which is set to read only should throw a new exception, instead of doing nothing.
- unseting a config name when is read only should throw an exception
- unseting a config name when not read only should unset the name, but it does not do anything
- config with numeric keys does not work
- ini file config does not accept section name as array


View constructor second option is not used to anything

?Need a translate object for router and locale

Yaf_Route_Static::match  is not used anywhere and doesn't do anything
Yaf_Route_Static doesn't have a constructor, so it's not possible to use it outside the framework.

Yaf_Route_Interface - should add a method getInstance which will create an instance of the router
 from the config. Each subclass will need to implement that method 
 
 Yaf_Route_Regex - what does the verify parameter in the constructor? Don't seem to be used anywhere.
 Yaf_Router_Map - _ctl_router should be boolean instead of int.
 Yaf_Loader - setLibaryPath instead of using a bool should be split into 2 methods, setLibaryPath and setGlobalPath
